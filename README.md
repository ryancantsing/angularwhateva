Hey guys! All you have to do is npm install and ng build and ng serve. I'm sorry, I'm not used to tortoiseSVN. I seriously don't think that what I've put together is hire-worthy.  It's not a big deal, let's still be friends. There's a message.txt in the app directory for you regarding my mistakes. Thank you for the opportunity to learn!
