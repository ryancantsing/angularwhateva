Oh man this is so much better.

I will say a few things about this- Firstly, thanks for letting me complete this a little more. 
It looks a lot more clickable now, and I got the time zone thing to work! It's a little complex, but I like how
it works now. It's not EXACTLY like the picture but I think it's pretty close. 

That being said, it lacks error proper error handling, and there are no comments in the CSS File. If there is comments
in the CSS file I probably panicked in the morning and quickly did it. 

The favorites system is the same. If you want to turn off favorites altogether, refresh the page to go back to
your favorite state by default and just hit the favorite button again. 

Once again I'm thankful you let me take another shot at this. I made a good weekend out of it and the Giants 
at least won a game on Saturday. Better than 0 wins, I guess.
